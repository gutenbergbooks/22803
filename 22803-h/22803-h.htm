<span class="i0">Love owes tribute unto Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being but a flower of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n as thy fair body is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moment's figure of the bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelling in the mind of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When He called thee from the sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a crocus up to start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray-eyed with a golden heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of earth, and point our sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy eternal home of light.<br /></span>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sing of the end of Troy, and of that flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passion by the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heroes consecrate, by poet's craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hallowed, if that thin waft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of godhead blown upon thee stretch thy song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To span such store of strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And splendid vision of immortal themes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late harvested in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit long years laid up in tilth. Most meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sing that slim and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair woman for whose bosom and delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paris, as well he might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought all the woe, and held her to his cost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy's, and won and lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perforce; for who could look on her or feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her near and not dare steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One hour of her, or hope to hold in bars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wonder of the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undimmed? As soon expect to cage the rose<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of dawn which comes and goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fitful, or leash the shadows of the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or music of upland rills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Helen's beauty and not tarnish it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy poor market wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adept to hue the wanton in the wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defile the undefiled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet by the oath thou swearedst, standing high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where piled rocks testify<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy dust, and from Therapnai's hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the rippling wold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst look upon Amyklai's, where sunrise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First dawned in Helen's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take up thy tale, good poet, strain thine art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing her rendered heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given last to him who loved her first, nor swerved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From loving, but was nerved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see through years of robbery and shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her spirit, a clear flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eloquent of her birthright. Tell his peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hers who at last found ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In white-arm'd Her&eacute;, holy husbander<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of purer fire than e'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wife gave Kypris. Helen, and Thee sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom her beauties ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair body of fair mind fair acolyte,<br /></span>

<h3>FIRST STAVE</h3>

<h4>THE DEATH OF ACHILLES</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where Simoeis and Xanthos, holy streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flow brimming on the level, and chance gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betray far Ida through a rended cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hint the awful home of Zeus, whose shroud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder is&mdash;'twixt Ida and the main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold gray Ilios, Priam's fee, the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her like a carpet; from whose height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watchman, ten years watching, every night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counteth the beacon fires and sees no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their number as the years wax and duress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hunger thins the townsmen day by day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than the Greeks kill plague and famine slay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here in their wind-swept city, ten long years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beset and in this tenth in blood and tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And havocry to fall, old Priam's sons<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Guard still their gods, their wives and little ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guard Helen still, for whose fair womanhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sin was done, woe wrought, and all the blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Danaan and Dardan in their pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed; nor yet so the end, for Her&eacute; cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrill on the heights more vengeance on wrong done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Greek or Trojan paid it. Late or soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sword or bitter arrow they went hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each with their goodliest paying one man's offence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goodliest in Troy fell Hector; back to Greek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then swung the doomstroke, and to Dis the bleak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must pass great Hector's slayer. Zeus on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden from men, held up the scales; the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told Thetis that her son must go the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent Queen Hecuba's&mdash;himself must pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself though young, splendid Achilles' self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price of manslaying, with blood for pelf.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A grief immortal took her, and she grieved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in sea-cave, whereover restless heaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine-dark ocean&mdash;silently, not moving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tearless, a god. O Gods, however loving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is a lonely grief that must go dry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the graves where the beloved lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows too much to doubt if death ends all<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasure in strength of limb, joy musical,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother-love, maiden-love, which never more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must the dead look for on the further shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Acheron, and past the willow-wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Proserpine!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But when he understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles, that his end was near at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkling he heard the news, and on the strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the ships he stood awhile, then cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sea-God that high-hearted and clear-eyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might go down; and this for utmost grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked, that not by battle might his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be marred, nor fighting might some Dardan best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him who had conquered ever. For the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate, which had given, might take, as fate should be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So prayed he, and Poseidon out of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There where the deep blue into sand doth fade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long wave rolls in, a bar of jade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent him a portent in that sea-blue bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than light, the halcyon; and men heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trumpet of his praise: "Shaker of Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail to thee! Now I fare to death in mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to a banquet!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">So when day was come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly arose the prince to meet his doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed Brise&iuml;s where she lay abed<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And never more by hers might rest his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Farewell, my dear, farewell, my joy," said he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Farewell to all delights 'twixt thee and me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now I take a road whose harsh alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid so sweet a burden to my arms."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his clean limbs his weeping squires bedight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the mail Hephaistos served his might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withal, of breastplate shining like the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon flood-water, three-topped helm whereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed the gold basilisk, and goodly greaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These bore he without word; but when from sheaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spears they picked the great ash Pelian<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poseidon gave to Peleus, God to a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no man's man&egrave;ge else&mdash;than all men's fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dry and cold fighting for thee this day, my spear,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth he. And so when one the golden shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal, daedal, for no one else to wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast o'er his head, he frowned: "On thy bright face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me see who shall dare a dint," he says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood in thought full-armed; thereafter poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libation at the tent-door to the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of earth and sky, and prayed, saying: "O Thou<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That hauntest dark Dodona, hear me now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since that the shadowing arm of Time is flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far over me, but cloudeth me full young.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scatheless I vow them. Let one Trojan cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spear and loose my spirit. Rage is past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I go forth my most provocative<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adventure: 'tis not I that seek. Receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My prayer Thou as I have earned it&mdash;lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying I stand, and hail Thee as I go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of the &AElig;gis, wonderful, most great!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which done, he took his stand, and bid his mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urge on the steeds; and all the Achaian host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed him, not with outcry or loud boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deeds to do or done, but silent, grim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to a shambles&mdash;so they followed him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyeing that nodding crest and swaying spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shake with the chariot. Solemn thus they near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan walls, slow-moving, as by a Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven; and thus before the Skaian Gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands he in pomp of dreadful calm, to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As once in dreadful haste to slay.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Thereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls were thick with men, and in the towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women stood gazing, clustered close as flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blur the rocks in some high mountain pass<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With delicate hues; but like the gray hill-grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the wind sweepeth, till in waves of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It tideth backwards&mdash;so all gray or white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed they, as sudden surges moved them cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads, or bare their faces. And none spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among them, for there stood not woman there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mourned her dead, or sensed not in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pendent doom of death, or worse than death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail as flowers were their faces, and all breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came short and quick, as on this dreadful show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staring, they pondered it done far below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on a stage where the thin players seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unkith to them who watch, the stuff of dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor else about the plain showed living thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save high in the blue where sailed on outspread wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vulture bird intent, with mighty span<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pinion.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the hush spake the dead man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hollow-voiced, terrible: "Ye tribes of Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stand I out for death, and ye for joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of killing as ye will, by cast of spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By bowshot or with sword. If any peer<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hector or Sarpedon care the bout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which they both tried aforetime let him out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With speed, and bring his many against one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing no treachery, for there shall be none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To aid me, God nor man; nor yet will I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stir finger in the business, but will die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By murder sooner than in battle fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under some Trojan hand."<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Breathless stood all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not moving out; but Paris on the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his high house, where snug he sat aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew taut the bowstring home, and notched a shaft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft whistling to himself, what time with craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peering eyes and narrow twisted face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought an aim.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Swift from her hiding-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came burning Helen then, in her blue eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fire unquenchable, but cold as ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scorcheth ere it strike a mortal chill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the heart. "Darest thou...?"<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Smiling still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heeded not her warning, nor he read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terror of her eyes, but drew and sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A screaming arrow, deadly, swerving not&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stood to watch the ruin he had wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He heard the sob of breath o'er all the host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hushing men; he marked, but then he lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood-spurt at the shaft-head; for the crest<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Upheaved, the shoulders stiffen'd, ere to the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent down the head, as though the glazing sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curious would mark the death-spot. Still upright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood he; but as a tree that on the side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida yields to axe her soaring pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightlier waves her leafy crown, and swings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From side to side&mdash;so on his crest the wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect seemed shaking upwards, and to sag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spear's point, and the burden'd head to wag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the stricken body felt the stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the strong knees grew lax, or the heart broke.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breathless they waited; then the failing man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stiffened anew his neck, and changed and wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked for the last time in the face of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to dare the Gods such might to slay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As this, the sanguine splendid thing he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withal now gray of face and pinched. Alas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pride of life! Now he had heard his knell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirit passed, and crashing down he fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mighty Achilles, and struck the earth, and lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A huddled mass, a bulk of bronze and clay<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bestuck with gilt and glitter, like a toy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There dropt a forest hush on watching Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the plain and watching ranks of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from a tower some woman keened him then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long thin cry that wavered in the air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As once before one wailed her Hector there.<br /></span>

<h3>SECOND STAVE</h3>

<h4>MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So he who wore his honour like a wreath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his brows went the dark way of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which being done, that deed of ruth and doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave breath to Troy; but on the Achaians gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settled like pall of cloud upon a land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swoons beneath it. Desperate they scanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each other, saying: "Now we are left by God,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the huts behind the wall abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heeding not Diomede, Idomeneus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor keen Odysseus, nor that friend of Zeus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mykenai's king, nor that robbed Menelaus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor bowman Teukros, Nestor wise, nor Aias&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge Aias, cursed in death! Peleides bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself with pride, but he went raving there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the high assembly Thetis made<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In honour of her son, to waft his shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace to Hades' house, after the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice a man's height for him who did suspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice a man's heart and render it to Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave it, after offerings paid and given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And games of men and horses, she brought forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His regal arms for hero of most worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the broad Danaan host, who was adjudged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Odysseus by all voices. Aias grudged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vote and wandered brooding, drawn apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his room-fellows, seeding in his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Envy, which biting inwards did corrode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mettle, and his ill blood plied the goad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his brain, until the wretch made mad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went muttering his wrongs, ill-trimmed, ill-clad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sightless and careless, with slack mouth awry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And working tongue, and danger in the eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft would stare at Heaven and laugh his scorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O fools, think not to trick me!" then forlorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would gaze about green earth or out to sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is the end of man in his degree"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus would he moralise in those bare lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hopeless brows and tossing up of hands&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To sow in sweat and see another reap!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, pitying himself, he'd fall to weep<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His desolation, scorned by Gods, by men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slighted; but in a flash he'd rage again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shake his naked sword at unseen foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dare them bring Odysseus to his blows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or let the man but flaunt himself in arms...!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So threatening God knows what of savage harms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On him the oxen patient in the marsh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knee-deep in rushes, gazed to hear his harsh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outcry; and them his madness taught for Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on their dumb immensity he wreaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vengeance, driving in the press with shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of "Aias! Aias!" hurtling, carving out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A way with mighty swordstroke, cut and thrust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes a shambles in his witless lust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst, bloodshot, with blank wild eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands frothing at the lips, and after lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All reeking in his madman's battlefield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sleeps nightlong. But with the dawn's revealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pity of his folly; then he sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself at his fool's work. With shaking knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stands amid his slaughter, and his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds to the wreck, plunging without a groan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his planted sword. So Aias died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lonely; and he who, never from his side<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Removed, had shared his fame, the Lokrian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abode the fate foreordered in the plan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the Blind Women ignorantly weave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But think not on the dead, who die and leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A memory more fragrant than their deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the remnant rather and their needs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give thought with me. What comfort in their swords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have they, robbed of the might of two such lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Peleus' son and Telamon's? What art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can drive the blood back to the stricken heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like huddled sheep cowed obstinate, as dull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As oxen impotent the wain to pull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of a rut, which, failing at first lunge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer not voice nor goad, but sideways plunge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or backward urge with lowered heads, or stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dumb monuments of sufferance&mdash;so unmanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Achaians brooded, nor their chiefs had care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive them forth, since they too knew despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And neither saw in battle nor retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A way of honour.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And the plain grew sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again with living green; the spring o' the year<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Came in with flush of flower and bird-call clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nature, for whom nothing wrought is vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of shed blood caused grass to spring amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed with tender irony to flout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's folly and pain when twixt dead spears sprang out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crocus-point and pied the plain with fires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More gracious than his beacons; and from pyres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of burnt dead men the asphodel uprose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like fleecy clouds flushed with the morning rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holy pall to hide his folly and pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus upon earth hope fell like a new rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by and by the pent folk within walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took heart and ploughed the glebe and from the stalls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led out their kine to pasture. Goats and sheep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cropt at their ease, and herd-boys now did keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch, where before stood arm&egrave;d sentinels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And battle-grounds were musical with bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of feeding beasts. Afar, high-beacht, the ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loomed through the tender mist, their prows&mdash;like lips<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of thirsty birds which, lacking water, cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salvation out of Heaven&mdash;flung on high:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which marking, Ilios deemed her worst of road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was travelled, and held Paris for a God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who winged the shaft that brought them all this peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He in their love went sunning, took his ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In house and hall, at council or at feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of what was greatest or what least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his deeds, so only by his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lay, the blush-rose Helen, stolen bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovely harbour of his arms. But she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thrall, now her own thralldom plain could see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sick of dalliance, loathed herself, and him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had beguiled her. Now through eyes made dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears she looked towards the salt sea-beach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where stood the ships, and sought for sign in each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it might be her people's, and so hers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor alien!&mdash;Argive now herself she avers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proudly slave of Paris and no wife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minion she calls herself; and when to strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love he claims her, secret her heart surges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to her lord; and when to kiss he urges,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And when to play he woos her with soft words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secret her fond heart calleth, like a bird's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards that honoured mate who honoured her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making her wife indeed, not paramour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, and sharer of his hearth and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gear. Thus every night: and on the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She watches every dawn for what dawn brings.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the strong spirit of her took new wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left her lovely body in the arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him who doted, conning o'er her charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And witless held a shell; but forth as light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the first sigh of dawn her spirit took flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the dusky plain to where fires gleamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And muffled guards stood sentry; and it streamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the hut, and hovered like a wraith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A presence felt, not seen, as when gray Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems to the dying man a bedside guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the watchers cannot be exprest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hovered Helen in a dream, and yearned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sleeper as he moaned and turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renewing his day's torment in his sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who presently starts up and sighing deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Searches the entry, if haply in the skies<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The day begin to stir. Lo there, her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like waning stars! Lo there, her pale sad face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Becurtained in loose hair! Now he can trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athwart that gleaming moon her mouth's droopt bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell all truth about her, and her woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dreadful store of knowledge. As one shockt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To worse than death lookt she, with horror lockt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind her tremulous tragic-moving lips:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O love, O love," saith he, and saying, slips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the bed: "Who hath dared do thee wrong?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No answer hath she, but she looks him long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep, and looking, fades. He sleeps no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But up and down he pads the beaten floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that day his heart's wild crying hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can thank God for gracious dew of tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tender thoughts of her, not thoughts of shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So came the next night, and with night she came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream-Helen; and he knew then he must go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence she had come. His need would have it so&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And her need. Never must she call in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now takes he way alone over the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dark yet hovers like a catafalque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all life swoons, and only dead thing walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uneasy sprites denied a resting space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shudder as they flit from place to place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bats of flaggy wing that make night blink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With endless quest: so do those dead, men think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fall and are unserved by funeral rite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These passes he, and nears the walls of might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Godhead built for proud Laomedon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows the house of Paris built thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terraced and set with gadding vines and trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever falling water, for the ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that sweet indweller he held in store.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither he turns him quaking, but before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him dares not look, lest he should see her there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aglimmer through the dusk and, unaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discover her fill some mere homely part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intolerably familiar to his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeply there enshrined and glorified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid up with bygone bliss. Yet on he hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being called, and ever closer on he came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if no wrong nor misery nor shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could harder be than not to see her&mdash;Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even if within that smooth thief's arms she lay<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Besmothered in his kisses&mdash;rather so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he stood stabbed to see, than on to go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His round of lonely exile!<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Now he stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath her house, and on his spear his hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest, and upon his hands he grounds his chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And motionless abides till day come in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure of his vice, that he might ease her woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not brand her with his own. Not yet the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of false dawn throbbed, nor yet the silent town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood washt in light, clear-printed to the crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cold upper air. Dark loomed the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghostly the trees, and still shuddered the calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of owl to owl from unseen towers. Afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog barked. High and hidden in the haar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which blew in from the sea a heron cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honk! and he heard his wings, but not espied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy flight. Slow, slow the orb was filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With light, and with the light his heart was thrilled<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With opening music, faint, expectant, sharp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the first chords one picks out from the harp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prelude paean. Venturing all, he lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, and there encurtained in a drift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sea-blue mantle close-drawn, he espies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helen above him watching, her grave eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon him fixt, blue homes of mystery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfathomable, eternal as the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as unresting.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">So in that still place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that still hour stood those two face to face.<br /></span>

<h3>THIRD STAVE</h3>

<h4>MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN</h4>

<div class="cpoem25"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But when he had her there, sharp root of ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him and his, safeguarded from him still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too sweet to be forgotten, too much marred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By usage to be what she seemed, bescarred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behandled, too much lost and too much won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mock image making horrible the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once had shown her pure for his demesne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still revealed her lovely, and unclean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair turned into stone what had been kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bitter surged his griefs, to flood his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O ruinous face," said he, "O evil head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou so early from the wicked bed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So prompt to slough the snugness of thy vice?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is it that in luxury thou art nice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become, and dalliest?" Low her head she hung<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And moved her lips. As when the night is young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow wind presages storm, his moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came wailing at her. "Ten years here, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in that time to have seen thee thrice!"<br /></span>
<span class="i16">But she:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Often and often have I chanced to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lord pass."<br /></span>
<span class="i6">His heart leapt, as leaps the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enwombed: "Hast thou&mdash;?"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Faintly her quick eyes smiled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"At this time my house sleepeth, but I wake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So have time to myself when I can take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New air, and old thought."<br /></span>
<span class="i12">As a man who skills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read high hope out of dark oracles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gleamed his eyes; so fierce and quick said he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lady, O God! Now would that I could be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside thee there, breathing thy breath, thy thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathering!" Silent stood she, memory-fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor looked his way. But he must know her soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So harpt upon her heart. "Is this the whole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wouldst have me think, that thou com'st here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone to be?"<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<span class="i6">She blushed and dared to peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Downward. "Is it so wonderful," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If I desire it?" He: "Nay, by my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so; but wonderful I think it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In any man to suffer it." The hiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passion stript all vesture from his tones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed the King man naked to the bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man naked to the body's utterance.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She turned her head, but felt his burning glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorch, and his words leap up. "Dost thou desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I leave thee then? Answer me that."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Nay, sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so." And he: "Bid me to stay while sleeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy house," he said, "so stay I." Her eyes' deeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flooded his soul and drowned him in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair and rage. "Behold now, ten years' wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between us and our love! Now if I cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spear and rove the snow-mound of thy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were that a marvel?"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Long she lookt and grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pondering his face and searching. "Not so brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lord as that would prove him. Nay, and I know<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He would not do it." And the truth was so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well he knew the reason: better she.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet for a little in that vacancy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silence and unshadowing light they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those long-divided, speechless. His first mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bitter grudge was choked, but hers was mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fearing his. At last she named the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asking, Was all well? Short he told her, Yes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child was well. She fingered in her dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched her hand at play there.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Here," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There is no child," and sighed. Into his dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wasted heart there leaped a flame and caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hollow eyes. "Rememberest thou naught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing regrettest, nothing holdst in grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all our joy together ere that thief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came rifling in?" For all her answer she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lookt long upon him, long and earnestly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And misty grew her eyes, and slowly filled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the great tears brimmed, and slowly rilled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown her cheeks. So presently she hid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those wells of grief, and hung her lovely head;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And he had no more words, but only a cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At heart too deep for utterance, and too high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And now came Paris from the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the sun, rosy and amorous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the sun himself from the sea-rim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifteth, and gloweth on the earth grown dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waiting; and he piped a low clear call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mellow as the thrush's at the fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of day from some near thicket. At whose sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up caught Helen and blushing turned her round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To face him; but in going, ere she met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince, her hand along the parapet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She trailed, palm out, for sign to who below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rent at himself, nor had the wit to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that dumb signal eloquence, and hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein beyond his sick heart's utmost scope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throbbing he stood as when a quick-blown peat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now white, now red, burns inly&mdash;O wild heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O ravenous race of men, who'd barter Space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Time for one short snatch of instant grace!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Withal, next day, drawn by his dear desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When as the young green burned like emerald fire<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In the cold light, back to the tryst he came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she was sooner there, and called his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softly as cooing dove her bosom's mate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed her eyes to him, which half sedate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be so sought revealed her, half in doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest he should deem her bold to meet the bout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With too much readiness. But high he flaunted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name towards the sky. "Thou God-enchanted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou miracle of dawn, thou Heart of the Rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail thou!" On his own eloquence he grows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lover he proclaims. "O love," he saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I would not leave thee for a moment's breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor once these ten long years had left thy side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had it been possible to stay!"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">She sighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wondered o'er his face, she looked her fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Museful, still doubting, smiling half, athrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All virgin to his praise. "O wonderful,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, "Such store of love for one so foul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I am now!"<br /></span>
<span class="i6">O fatal hot-and-cold,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O love, whose iris wings not long can hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The upper air! Sudden her thought smote hot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On him. "Thou sayest! True it is, God wot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm from his bed, and tears for thy unworth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm from his bed, and tears to meet my mirth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then back to his bed ere yet thy tears be dry!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She heard not, but she knew his agony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of burning vision, and kept back her tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until his pity moved in tune with hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards herself. But he from thunderous brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frowned on. "No more I see thee by this house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except to slay thee when the hour decree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An end to this vile nest of cuckoldry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holy vows made hateful, save thou speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each my question sooth. Keep dry thy cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tears, hide up thy beauty with thy grief&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or let him have his joy of them, thy thief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What time he may. Answer me thou, or vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thine hour strike to look for me again."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With hanging head and quiet hanging hands,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With lip atremble, as caught in fault she stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce might he hear her whispered message:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"Ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, and I answer thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Strung to his task:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me now all," he said, "from that far day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whenas embracing thee, I stood to pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poured forth wine unto the thirsty earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Zeus and to Poseidon, in whose girth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie sea and land; to Gaia next, their spouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next to Her&eacute;, mistress of my house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traitress, and thine, for grace upon my faring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou wert by to hear me, false arm bearing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my shoulder, glowing, lying cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next unto mine. Ay, and thou prayedst, with meek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair seeming, prosperous send-off and return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me what then, tell all, and let me learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what pretence that dog-souled slaked his thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy sweet liquor. Tell me that the first."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Helen lifted up her head, and beamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear light upon him from her eyes, which seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blue which, lying on the white sea-bed<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And gazing up, the sunbeam overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would show, with green entinctured, and the warp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inwoven of golden shafts, blended yet sharp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that a glory mild and radiant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfigured them. Upon him fell aslant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lovely light, while in her cheeks the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of throbbing dawn came sudden. So he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her best before she spoke; for when she spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was as if the nightingale should croak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In April midst the first young leaves, so bleak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So harsh she schooled her throat, that it should speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry matter and hard logic&mdash;as if she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were careful lest self-pity urged a plea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was not hers to make; or as one faint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And desperate lays down all his argument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bricks upon a field, let who will make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A house of them; so drily Helen spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a flat voice. "Thou hadst been nine days gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came my lord Alexandros, Priam's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hailed me in the hall whereas I sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And claimed his guest-right, which not wondering at<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave as fitting was. Then came the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was beguiled. What more is there to say?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fixt on her fingers playing on the wall<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes were. But the King said: "Tell me all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert beguiled: by his desire beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by thine own?" She shook her head and smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most sadly, pitying herself. "Who knoweth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ways of Love, whence cometh, whither goeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart's low whimper? This I know, he loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me then, and pleasured only where I moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the house. And I had pleasure too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know of me he had it. Then we knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day at hand when he must take the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave me; and its eve we close abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the house, and spake not. But I wept."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stayed, and whispering down her next word crept:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I was beguiled, beguiled." And then her lip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bit, and rueful showed her partnership<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sinful dealing.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">But he, in his esteem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleeding and raw, urged on. "To Kranai's deme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took thee then?"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Speechless she bent her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards her tender breasts whereon, soft shed<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As upon low quiet hills, the dawn light played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And limned their gentle curves or sank in shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gazing, stood she silent, but the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urged on. "From thence to Ilios, thou willing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took thee?"<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then, "I was beguiled," again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said; and he, who felt a worthier strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stir in his gall compassion, and uplift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him out of knowledge, saw a blessed rift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his dark horizon, as tow'rds night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The low clouds break and shafted shows the light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ten years beguiled!" he said, "but now it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art&mdash;&mdash;" She shook her head. "Nay, now come dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, now I think, remember, now I see."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"What callest thou to mind?" "Hermione,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, "our child, and Sparta my own land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the honour that lay to my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I but chosen it, as now I would"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sudden hid her face up in her hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her courage ebbed in grief, all hardness drowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bitter weeping.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Noble pity crowned<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The greater man in him; so for a space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wept together, she for loss; for grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gain wept he. "No more," he said, "my sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me no more."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"Ah, hear the whole of it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my hour is gone," she cried. But he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groaning, "I dare not stay here lest I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him take thee again."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Both hands to fold her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shook her head; like as the sun through mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone triumph in her eyes. "Have no more fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him or any&mdash;&mdash;" Then, hearing a stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the house, her finger toucht her lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one fixt look she gave of fellowship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assured&mdash;then turned and quickly went her way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his light vanisht with her for that day.<br /></span>

<h3>FOURTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>THE APOLOGY OF HELEN</h4>

<div class="cpoem25"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O singing heart, O twice-undaunted lover!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O ever to be blest, twice blest moreover!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice over win the world in one girl's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice over lift her name up to the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice to hope all things, so to be twice born&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he lives not who cannot front the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "This day I live as never yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived striving man on earth!" What if the fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loss and ten years' agonizing snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hairs or leave their tracery on thy brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each line beslotted by the demon hounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunting thee down o' nights? Laugh at thy wounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh at thy eld, strong lover, whose blood flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear from the fountain, singing as it goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"She loves, and so I live and shall not die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love on, love her: 'tis immortality."<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Once more before the sun he greeted her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She glowed her joy; her mood was calm and clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mellow evening's whenas, like a priest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain has absolved the world, and golden mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs over all like benediction.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her proud eyes sat triumph on a throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know herself beloved, her lover by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near the consummation. Womanly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She dallied with the moment when, all wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his breast she'd lie and cast her life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast body, soul and spirit in one gest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supreme of giving. Glorying in his quest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her, now let her hide what he must glean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not know yet. Ah, sweet to feel his keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long eye-search, like the touch of eager fingers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet to thrill beneath such hot blush-bringers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fence with such a swordsman hazardous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet. "Belov'd, thou art glad of me!" Then thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antiphonal to him she breathes, "Thou sayest!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I see thy light and hail it!"<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Thou begayest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My poor light."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"Knowest thou not that thou art loved?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"And am I loved then?"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">"If thou'ldst have it proved,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Look in my eyes. Would thine were open book!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Palimpsest I," she said, and would not look.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he was grappling now with truth, would have it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though it cost him all his gain. She gave it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking him along. "O lady mine," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now are my clouds dispers&eacute;d every shred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art mine; I think thou lovest me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak, is that true?"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">She could not, or may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not hold her gaze, but let it fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched her fingers idling on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so remained; but urged to it by the spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cast, she whispered down, "I cannot tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee here, and thus apart"&mdash;which when he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its full import drove him well-nigh mad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With longing. "Call me and I come!"<br /></span>
<span class="i14">But fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flamed in her eyes: "No, no, 'tis death! He's here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At hand. 'Tis death for thee, and worse than death&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ended so&mdash;"for both of us."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">And breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Failed him, for well he knew now what she meant,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And sighed his thanks to Gods beneficent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thereafter in sweet use of lovers' talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In boon spring weather, whenas lovers walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Handfasted through the meadows pied, and wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dew from flower and leaf, these lovers met&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two bodies separate, one wild heart between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day, these two long-severed been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of this mating of the eye and tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There grew desire passionate and strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For body's mating and its testimony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearts' intimacy, perfect, full and free.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Helen for her heart's ease did deny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her girdled Goddess of the beamy eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "Come you down, Mistress of sleek loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And panting nights: your service of bought doves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honey-hearted wine may cost too dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hast thou done for me since first my ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy sly music thou didst sign and seal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apprentice to thy mystery, teach me feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fierce divinity in the trembling touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of open lips? Served I not thee too much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Kranai and in Sparta my demesne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too much in wide-wayed Ilios, Eastern Queen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, but it was too much a thousandfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what was I but leman bought and sold?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"For woman craved what mercy hath man brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What face a woman for a woman sought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What mercy or what face? And what saith she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hunted, scorn&eacute;d wretch? Boast that she be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coveted, hankered, spat on? One to gloat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of sun and wind, of flower and leaf, and song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bird, or shout of children as they throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world of mated men and women? Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persuade me not, O Kypris; but I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evil hath been the lore which thou hast taught&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many have loved my face, and many sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My breast, and thought it joy supping thereat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweetness and dear delight; but out of that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hath there come to them, to me and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine but hot shame? Not milk, but bitter gall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So in her high passion she rent herself<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the grim wall, lest he should see the whole<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But he by pity pure made bountiful<br /></span>

<span class="i10">She said, "I was beguiled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To know him craven, dog, not man, revealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A panting drudge of lust, who held me here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caged vessel. Nay, come close. I loved him dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too dear, I know; but never till he came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had known the leap of joy, the fire of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the heart he gave me, Paris the bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose memory was music and his sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fragrance, whose nearness made my footfall dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose touch was fever, and his burning glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faintness and blindness; in whose light my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Centred; who was the sun, and I, false wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foolish flower that turns whereso he wheels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the broad earth's canopy, and steals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Colour from his strong beam, but at the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whenas the night comes and the day is past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Droops, burnt at the heart. So loved I him, and so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waxed bold to dare the deed that brought this woe."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there she changed, and bitter was her cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, lord, far better had it been to die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I had cast this pain on thee, and shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On me, and wrought such outrage on our name.<br /></span>

<span class="i10">"Ay, and give life!" he said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet this thing more I'd have thee tell&mdash;what led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy thought to me? From him, what turned thy troth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such troth as there could be?"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">She cried, "The oath!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all the host sat down to watch you twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do battle, which should have me. For my part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took me forth to watch; as in the mart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heifer feels the giver of the feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pinch in her flank, and hears the chaffer twist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that for so much fat or lean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so was I, a queen, child of a queen."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She bit her lip until the blood ran free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her eyes he markt deep injury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scald as the salt tears welled; but "Listen yet,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said: "Ye fought, and Paris fell beset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under thy spurning heel, yet felt no whit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitterness as I must come to it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she, his Goddess, hid him up in mists<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought him beat and broken from the lists<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here to his chamber. But I stood and burned,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Shameful to be by one lost, by one earned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prize for games, a slave, a bandied thing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since as the oath was made so must I swing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bed to bed. But while I stood and wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melted in fruitless sorrow, up she crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me, his Goddess, gliding like a snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wreathed her arms and whispering me go make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nuptial couch, 'What oath binds love?' did say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loathing him, I must go. He had his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well he might who paid that goodly price,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour, truth, courage, all, to have his vice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which forsook him when those fair things fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though my body hath lain in his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart abhors it. And now in truth I wis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lord's true heart is where my own heart is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The two together welded and made whole;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will go to him and give my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shamed and faded body to his nod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spurn or take; and he shall be my God."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereat made virgin, as all women are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By love's white purging fire which leaves no scar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all was soiled and seamed before the torch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Eros toucht the heart, and the keen scorch<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lickt up the foul misuse of vase so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As woman's body, Helen flusht and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned from the wall a fire-hued seraph's face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in one rapt long look gave and took Grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in her eyes he saw the light divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick in him ran fierce joy of it like wine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light unto light made answer, as a flag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answers when men tell tidings from one crag<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto another, and from peak to peak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good news flashes. Scarcely could he speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Measurable words, so high his wild thought whirled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bride, Goddess, Helen, O Wonder of the World,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I come for thee?"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Her tender words came soft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dropping rose petals on garden croft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from the wall's sheer height&mdash;"Come soon, come soon."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And homing to the lines those drummed his tune.<br /></span>

<h3>FIFTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>A COUNCIL OF THE ACHAIANS:
THE EMBASSY OF ODYSSEUS</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now calleth he assembly of the chiefs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Princes and kings and captains, them whose griefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease his own like treasure had been lent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who came and sat at board within the tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him they hailed host-father and their lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this adventure, in aught else abhorred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all true men. He sits above the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fox-red Agamemnon, round his crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The circlet of his kingship over kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at his thigh the sword gold-hilted swings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Zeus gave Atreus once; and in his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gnawing doubt which twice had checkt his start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For high emprise, having twice egged him to it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As stout Odysseus knew who had to rue it.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside him Nestor sat, Nestor the old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White as the winter moon, with logic cold<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Instilled, as if the blood in him had fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his veins clear spirit ran instead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made men reasons and not fired their sprites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next Idomeneus of countless fights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrewd leader of the Cretans; by his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen-flashing Diomedes in his pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young, the wild in onset, whose war-shrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next after Peleus' son's, held all Troy still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stayed the gray crows at their ravelling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dead men's bones. Into debate full fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went he, adone with tapping of the foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drumming on the board. Had but his suit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been granted&mdash;so he said&mdash;the war were done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy a name ere full three years had gone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as for Helen and her daintiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy held a mort of women who no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than she could pleasure night when work was over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men came home ready to play the lover;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in housework would better her. Let Helen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be laid by Paris, villain, and dead villain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead long ago if he had taken the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of Menelaus. Then no shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Kypris' golden body been, acquist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his sword-arm already, near the wrist!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So Diomedes. Next him sat a man<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With all his woe to come, the Lokrian<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aias, son of O&iuml;leus, bearded swart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, with his little eyes, and legs too short<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arms too long, a giant when he sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwarf else, and in the fight a tiger-cat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mark his neighbour, mark him well: to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falleth the lot to lay a charge more grim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On woman fair than even Althaia felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like lead upon her heartstrings, when she knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blew to flame the brand that held the life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her own son; or Procne with the knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who slew and dressed her child to be a meal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his own father. But this man's thews were steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steely were the nerves about his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they had need. Mark him, and mark the part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He plays hereafter. Odysseus is his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wily Ithacan, deathless in his fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his substance deathless, since he goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal forth and back wherever blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder of thy rhythm, O blind King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First of the tribe of them with songs to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fountain of storied music and its end&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who the poet since who doth not tend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To essay thy leaping measure, or call down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy nodded approbation for his crown<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all his wages?<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Other chiefs sat there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In order due: as Pyrrhos, very fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And young, with high bright colour, and the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of evening in his eyes of violet-blue&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of Achilles he, and new to war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Antiklos and Teukros, best by far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the bowmen in the host. And last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Menestheus the Athenian dikast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who led the folk from Pallas's fair home.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To them spake Menelaus, being come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into assembly last, and taken in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spokesman's staff: "Ye princes of our land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adventurous Achaians, stout of heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good news I bring, that now we may depart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each to his home and kindred, each to his hearth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wife and children dear and well-tilled garth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contented with the honour he has brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me and mine, since I have what we've sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bitter pain and loss. Yea, even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath Her&eacute; crowned your strife and earned my vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made these ten years come harvest, having drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veil from off those eyes than which not dawn<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Holds sweeter light nor holier, once they see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, chieftains, Helen's heart comes back to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fast she watches now hard by the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wicked house, and ere the cock shall call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another morn I have her in my arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeemed for Sparta, pure of Trojan harms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole-hearted and clean-hearted as she came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, before Paris and his deed of shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threatened my house with wreck, and on his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have brought no joy. This night, disguised, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stand within the city, waiting day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when men sleep, all in the shadowless gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robbing the robber, I drop down with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the wall&mdash;and lo! the end of the war!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus great of heart and high of heart he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trembling ceased. Awhile none cared to break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silence, like unto that breathless hush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That holds a forest ere the great winds rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the sea-gulf, bringing furious rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mist to drown all nature, blot the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one great sheet of water without form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So held the chiefs. Then Diomede brake in storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ever the first he was to fling his spear<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Into the press of battle; dread his cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the long howling of a wolf at eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or clamour of the sea-birds when they grieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hanker the out-scouring of the net<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden behind the darkness and the wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tempest-ridden nights. "Princes," he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What say ye to this wooer of his bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom it seems ten nations and their best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have fought ten years to bring her back to nest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this your meed of honour? Was it for this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You flung forth fortune&mdash;to ensure him his?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he made snug at home, we seek our lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barer than we left them, with emptier hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some with fewer members, shed that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might fare as soft and trim as formerly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so went I adventuring, good friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so look I this business to have end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but I fight to live, not live to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so will live by day as thou by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sating my eyes with havoc on this race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of robbers of the hearth; see their strong place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought level with the herbage and the weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That where they revelled once shrew-mice may feed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moles make palaces, and bats keep house.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And if thou art of spleen so slow to rouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As quit thy score by thieving from a thief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave him scatheless else, thou art no chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Tydeus' son, who sees no end of strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in his own or in his foeman's life."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So he. Then Pyrrhos spake: "By that great shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein I stand, which thy false Paris made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who slew my father, think not so to have done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Troy and Priam; for Peleides' son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must slake the sword that cries, and still the ghost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him that haunts the ingles of this coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murdered and unacquit while that man's father<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liveth."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then leapt up two, and both together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, "Give us Troy to sack, give us our fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold and bronze; give us to burn and kill!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Aias said, "Are there no women then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Troy, but only her? And are we men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or virgins of Athen&eacute;?" And the dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her who served that dauntless One made gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shifting eyes, and stretcht his fleshy lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind his beard.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then stood that prince of ships<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And shipmen, great Odysseus; with one hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He held the staff, with one he took command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus in measured tones, with word intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the deed, fierce but not vehement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drave in his dreadful message. At his sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clamour died down, even as the wind at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls and is husht at rising of the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ye chieftains of Achaia, not so soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is strife of ten years rounded to a close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither so are men seated, friends or foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For say thus lightly we renounced the meed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our long travail, gave so little heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our great dead as find in one man's joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full recompense for all we've sunk in Troy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wives desolate, children fatherless, lands, gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stock without master, wasting year by year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth past, age creeping on, friends, brothers, sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost in the void, gone where no respite runs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sorrow, but the darkness covers all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What name should we bequeath our sons but thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what beside a name, who let go by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ilios the rich for others' usury?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have the blessed Gods no say in this?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think you they be won over by a kiss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her&eacute; the Queen, she, the unwearied aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all our striving, Pallas the war-maid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have they not vowed, and will ye scant their hate,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Havoc on Ilios from gate to gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for her towers abasement to the dust?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, O King, lust shall be paid with lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treachery with treachery, and for blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood shall be shed. Therefore let loose the flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our pent passion; break her gates in, raze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls of her, cumber her pleasant ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dead men; set on havoc, sate with spoil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men ravening; get corn and wine and oil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women to clasp in love, gold, silken things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harness of flashing bronze, swords, meed of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chariots and horses swifter than the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, coursing Ida, leaves ruin behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of snapt tall trees: not faster shall they fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Trojan spears once we are on the wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So only shall ye close this agelong strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor by redemption of a too fair wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now smiling, now averse, now hot, now cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Menelaus, may the tale be told!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but by slaying of Achilles' slayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the betrayal of the bed-betrayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By not withholding from the spoils of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men freeborn, nor from them that beaten are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their rueful wages. Ilios must fall."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said, and sat, and heard the acclaim of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save of the sons of Atreus, who sat glum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One flusht, one white as parchment, and both dumb;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">One raging to be contraried, one torn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By those two passions wherewith he was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lust for body's ease and lust of gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then slow he rose, Mykenai's king of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentle his voice to hear. "Laertes' son,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, but 'twas Nestor he looked upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wise old man who sat beside his chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mild now who once, a lion, kept his lair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untoucht of any, or if e'er he left it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left it for prey, and held that when he reft it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From foe, or over friend made stronger claim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Laertes' son," the king said, "all men's fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reports thee just and fertile in device;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the friend of God great is thy price<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us of Argos; for without the Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should we look to trace the limitless roads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That weave a criss-cross 'twixt us and our home?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to now, some will stay and other some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take to the sea-ways, hasty to depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not warfaring as men fare to the mart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To best a neighbour in some chaffering bout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But honour is the prize wherefor they go out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And having that, dishonoured are content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave the foe&mdash;that is best punishment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Natheless since men there be, Argives of worth,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who needs must shed more blood ere they go forth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if of blood enough had not been spilt!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devise thou with my brother if thou wilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noble Odysseus, seeking how compose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His honour with thy judgment. Well he knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy singleness of heart, deep ponderer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lover of a fair wife, and sure of her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, let this be the sum of our debate."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Content you," Menelaus said, "I wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon thy word, thou fosterling of Zeus."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then said Odysseus, "Be it as you choose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye sons of Atreus. Then, advised, I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me win into Troy as best I may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek out the lovely lady of our land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn of her the watchwords, see how stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sentries, how the warders of the gates;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strength, how much it is; what prize awaits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown our long endeavour. These things learned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the ships I come ere yet are burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watch-fires of the night, before the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath urged his steeds the course they are to run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the golden gateways of the East."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which all agreed, and Helen's lord not least.<br /></span>

<h3>SIXTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like as the sweet free air, when maids the doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And windows open wide, wanders the floors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the passage ways about the house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen marshal of the sun, or serious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cool gray light of morning 'gins to peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet the household stirs, or chanticlere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls hinds to labour but hints not the glee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor full-flood glory of the day to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When round about the hill the sun shall swim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burn a sea-path&mdash;so demure and slim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Helen on her business with swift feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light, yet recollected, and her sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secret held hid, that she was loved where need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called her to mate, and that she loved indeed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, sacred calm of wedlock, passion white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lovers knit in Her&eacute;'s holy light!<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But while in early morn she wonned alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Paris slept, shrill rose her singing tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brave the light on kindled cheeks and eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave as her hope is, brave the flag she flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, as the hour drew on when the sun's rim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should burn a sheet of gold to herald him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Ida's snowy crest, lithe as a pard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some lord's pleasuring encaged and barred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paced the hall soft-footed up and down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly and feverishly with quick frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peered shrewdly this way, that way, like a bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on the winter grass is aye deterred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His food-searching by hint of unknown snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thicket, holt or bush, or lawn too bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon stopped, lip to finger, while the tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat from her heart against her shielded side&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now closely girdled went she like a maid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then slipt to the window, where she stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But minutes three or four; for soon she past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out to the terrace, there to be at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Downgazing on her glory, which her king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflected up in every motioning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flux of his high passion. Only here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She triumphed, nor cared she to ask how near<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The end of Troy, nor hazarded a guess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What deeds must do ere that could come to pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her the instant homage held all joy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what to her was Sparta, or what Troy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the bliss of that?<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Or Paris, what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he, who daily, nightly plained his lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have risked all the world and ten years loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This woman, now to find her nothing moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what he had done with her, what desired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do? And more she chilled the less he tired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more he ventured less she cared recall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was to her of nothing worth, or all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All if the King required it of her, nought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he who now could take it. It was bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his by bargain: let him have it then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let it be for giving once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the rubies in the world's deep heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could fetch no price beside it.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Yet apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She brooded on the man who held her chained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minister to his pleasure, and disdained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him more the more herself she must disparage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflecting on him all her hateful carriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So old, incredible, so flat, so stale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more to be recalled than old wife's tale;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And scorned him, saw him neither high nor low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not villain and not hero, who would go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midway 'twixt baseness and nobility,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not be fierce, if fierceness hurt a flea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his eyes. The man loved one thing more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the world, and made his mind a whore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To minister his heart's need, for a price.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All which she loathed, yet chose not to be nice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the snug-revelling wretch, her master yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose leaguer, though she scorned it, was no fret;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lift on wings of her exalted mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She let him touch and finger what he would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unconscious of his being&mdash;as he saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a groan, whipt sharp upon the raw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his esteem, "Ah, cruel art thou turned,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would cry, "Ah, frosty fire, where I am burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dying bless the flame that is my bane!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which to clasp her closer was he fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To touch in love, and feast his eyes to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her quiver at his touch, and laugh to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plucker of such chords of such a rote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughing stoop and kiss her milky throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then see her shut eyes hide what he had done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, shut them not upon me, nay, nor shun<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My worship!" So he said; but she, "They fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But are not yet so old as thou hast made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul thou pinnest here beneath my breasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which you have loved too well." His hand he rests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over one fair white bosom like a cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaning, of her lips his own must sup;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she will not, but gently doth refuse it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a reason, save she doth not choose it.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then when he flung away, she sat alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nursed her hope and sorrow, both in one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perturb&eacute;d bosom; and her fingers wove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White webs as far afield her wits did rove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpending and perpending. So frail, so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So faint she seemed, a wraith you had said there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman dead, and not in lovely flesh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the while she writhed within the mesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of circumstance, and fiercely flamed her rage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O slave, O minion, thing kept in a cage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this sleek master's handling!" So she fumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What time her wide eyes sought all ways, or loomed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like winter lakes dark in a field of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still; nor lifted they their pall of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Responsive to her heart, nor flashed the thrill<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That knew, which said, "A true man loveth me still."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">That same night, as she used, fair Helen went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the suppliants in the hall, and lent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each who craved the bounty of her grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her gentle touch on wounds, her pitiful face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beaten eyes' dumb eloquence, that art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She above all could use, to stroke the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plead compassion in bestowing it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with her handmaids busy did she flit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From man to man, 'mid outlaws, broken blades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robbed husbandmen, their robbers, phantoms, shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what were men till hunger made them less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than man can be and still know uprightness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whom she spake with kindly words and cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him the light of hope began to peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glimmer in his eyes; and him she fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nourisht, then sent homeward comforted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little, to endure a little more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now among these, hard by the outer door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She marked a man unbent whose sturdy look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never left hers for long, whose shepherd's hook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed not a staff to prop him, whose bright eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned steadily, as fire when the wind dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great in the girth was he, but not so tall<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By a full hand as many whom the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed like gaunt channel-posts by an ebb tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left stranded in a world of ooze. Beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His knees she kneeled, and to his wounded feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Applied her balms; but he, from his low seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the wall, leaned out and in her ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered, but so that no one else could hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Other than my wounds are there for thy pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, and deeper. One, a grievous, drains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great heart of a king, and one is fresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though ten years old, in the sweet innocent flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a young child."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Nothing said she, but stoopt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The closer to her task. He thought she droopt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head, he knew she trembled, that her shoulder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twitcht as she wrought her task; so he grew bolder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "But thou art pitiful! I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt wash their wounds."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">She whispered "Oh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be sure of me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then he, "Let us have speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secret together out of range or reach<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of prying ears, if such a chance may be."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then she said, "Towards morning look for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, when the city sleeps, before the sun."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So till the glimmer of dawn this hardy one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keepeth the watch in Paris' house. All night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hard unwinking eyes he sat upright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all about the sleepers lay, like stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Littered upon a hill-top, save that moans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighings and "Gods, have pity!" showed that they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night rehearsed the miseries of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by bread lived not but by hope deferred.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grimly he suffered till such time he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helen's light foot and faint and gray in the mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descried her slim veiled outline, saw her twist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slip between the sleepers on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atiptoe coming, swift, with scarce a sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not faltering in fear. No fear she had.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From head to foot a sea-blue mantle clad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lovely shape, from which her pale keen face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone like the moon in frosty sky. No case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his to waver, for her eyes spake true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Heaven upon the world. Him then she drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow her, out of the house, to where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ilex trees stood darkly, and the air<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Struck sharp and chill before the dawn's first breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood a little altar underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An image: Artemis the quick deerslayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-girdled and barekneed; to Whom in prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First bowed, then stood erect with lifted hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palms upward, Helen. "Lady of open lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lakes and windy heights," prayed she, "so do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me as to Amphion's wife when blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind of thy high anger, and she stared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sudden death that not one dear life spared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all she had&mdash;so do to me if false<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I prove unto this Argive!"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Then the walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gates of Ilios she traced in the sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him of the watch-towers, and how manned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates at night; and where the treasure was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the houses of the chiefs. But as<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She faltered in the tale, "Show now," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where Priam's golden palace is."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">But she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, "Nay, not that; for since the day of shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brought me in, no word or look of blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he cast on me. Nay, when Hector died<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all the city turned on me and cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name, as to an outcast dog men fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howling and scorn, not one word said the King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they hissed me in the shrines of the Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And women egged their children on with nods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To foul the house-wall, or in passing spat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards it, he, the old King, came and sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily with me, and often on my hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would lay a gentle hand. Him thou shalt spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my sake who betray him."<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Odysseus said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, thou shalt speak no more of him. His bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not of thy making, nor mine, but his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath thee here a cageling, thy Paris.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him he begat as well as Hector. Now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Priam look to reap what he did sow."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when glad light brimmed o'er the cup of earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrill birds called forth men to grief or mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As might afford their labour under the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helen advised how best to get him gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fetched a roll of cord, the which made fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About a stanchion, about him next she cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About and about until the whole was round<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His body, and the end to his arm she bound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then showed him in the wall where best foothold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be, and watcht him down as fold by fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paid the cable out; and as he paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So did she twist it, till the coil was made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it had been at first. Then watcht she him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stride o'er the plain until he twinkled dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sank into the mist.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">That day came not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Menelaus to the trysting spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere Odysseus left her she had ta'en<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crocus flower which on her breast had lain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toucht it with her lips. "Give this," said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To my good lord who hath seen the flower in me."<br /></span>

<h3>SEVENTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>THEY BUILD THE HORSE AND ENTER IN</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What weariness of wind and wave and foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to be for Odysseus ere his home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scrub and crag and scanty pasturage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw again! What stress of pilgrimage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through roaring waterways and cities of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sojourn among folk beyond the ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mortal seafarers in homelier seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More trodden lands! Sure, none had earned his ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he, that windless morning when he drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near silent Ithaca, gray in misty blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondered on the old familiar scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was to him as it had never been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aforetime. Say, had he but had inkling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in this hour all that long wandering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his was self-ensured, had he been bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plan and carry what must now be told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this too hardy champion? Solve it you<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whose chronicling is over. Mine's to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All day until the setting of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devising how to use what he had won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Odysseus stood; for nothing within walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hid, he knew the very trumpet-calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith they turned the guard out, and the cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sentries used to hearten or advise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city in the watches of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once in, no hope for Ilios; but his plight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No better stood for that, since no way in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could he conceive, nor entry hope to win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For any force enough to seize the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And open for the host.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">But then some Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, some men say, Athen&eacute; the gray-eyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever his friend, never far from his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompted him look about him. Then he heeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stork set motionless in the dry reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lift their withered arms, a skeleton host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long after winter and her aching frost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are gone, and rattle in the spring's soft breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry bones, as if to daunt the budding trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warn them of the summer's wrath to come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still sat the bird, as fast asleep or numb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cold, her head half-buried in her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With close-shut eyes: a dead bird on the nest,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Arrow-shot&mdash;for behold! a wound she bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid-breast, which stooping to, to see the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, forth from it came busy, one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light-moving ants! So she to her death had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These many days; and there where she lost life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her carrion shell with it again was rife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So teems the earth, that ere our clay be rotten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New hosts sweep clean the hearth, our deeds forgotten.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But stooping still, Odysseus saw her not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor her brisk tenantry; afar his thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after it his vision, crossed the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lit on Ilios, dim and lapt in rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piled up like blocks which Titans rear to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hero of their breed sits stiff and stark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spear in dead hand, and dead chin on dead knees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Ha," cried he, "proud hinderer of our ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hold I thee within my hollowed hand!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Straightway returning, Troy's destruction planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sends for one Epeios, craftsman good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bids him frame him out a horse in wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big-bellied as a ship of sixty oars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as men use for traffic, not in wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor piracy, but roomy, deep in the hold,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where men may shelter if needs be from cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sleep between their watches. "Scant not you,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "your timber not your sweat. Drive through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This horse for me, Epeios, as if we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaited it to give the word for sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hellas and our wives and children dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this is true, without it we stay here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another ten-year shift, if by main force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We would take Troy, but ten days with my horse."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So to their task Epeios and his teams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went valiantly, and heaved and hauled great beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of timber from far Ida, and hacked amain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rought the framework out. Then to it again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They went with adzes and their smoothing tools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made all shapely; next bored for their dools<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With augurs, and made good stock on to stock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mortise and with dovetail. Last, they lock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frames with clamps, the nether to the upper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And body forth a horse from crest to crupper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In outline.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Now their ribbing must be shaped<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With axe to take the round, first rought, then scraped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With adzes, then deep-mortised in the frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear the weight of so much mass, whose fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all was won, the Earth herself might quake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supporting on her broad breast. Now they take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planks sawn and smoothed, and set them over steam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cauldrons to be supple. These to the beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above they rivet fast, and bend them down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from the belly more they seem to have grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than in it to be ended, so well sunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grooved they be. There's for the horse's trunk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as for head and legs, these from the block<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Epeios carved, and fixed them on the stock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long pins spigotted and clamps of steel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the tail, downsweeping to the heel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He carved and rivetted in place. Yet more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did; for cunningly he made a door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the belly of him, in a part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Nature lends her aid to sculptor's art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And few would have the thought to look for it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or eyes so keen to find, if they'd the wit.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Greatly stood he, hogmaned, with wrinkled n&eacute;ck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrying jaw, as though upon the check<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One rode him. On three legs he stood, with one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pawing the air, as if his course to run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was overdue. Almost you heard the champ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clatter of the bit, almost the stamp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scrape of hoof; almost his fretful crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed to toss on high. So much confest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondering host. "But where's the man to ride?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They askt. Odysseus said, "He'll go inside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet there shall seem a rider&mdash;nay, let two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bespan so brave a back," Epeios anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spurred, and had his horsemen as he would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two noble youths, star-frontletted, but nude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of clothing, and unarmed, who sat as though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Centaurs not men, and with their knees did show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The road to travel. Next Odysseus bid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Gild thou me him, Epeios"; which he did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And burnisht after, till he blazed afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like that great image which men hail for a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of omen holy, image without peer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chryselephantine Athen&eacute; with her spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining o'er Athens; to which their course they set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When homeward faring through the seaways wet<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From Poros or from Nauplia, or some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Eub&#339;an gulf, or where the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washes the feet of Sounion, on whose brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a white crown the shafts burn even now.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such was the shaping of the Horse of Wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bane of Ilios.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Ordered now they stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midway between the ships and Troy, and cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lots, who should go in from first to last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the chieftains chosen. And the lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leapt out of Diomede, so in he got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat up in the neck. Next Aias went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping his shins and blinking as he bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working the ridges of his villainous brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like puzzled, patient monkey on a bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That peers with bald, far-seeing eyes, whose scope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And steadfastness seem there to mock our hope;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next Antiklos, and next Meriones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cretan; next good Teukros. After these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Pyrrhos, Agamemnon, King of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Menestheus and Idomeneus, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Menelaus; and Odysseus last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entered the desperate doorway, and made fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the Achaian remnant, seeing their best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this great venture finally addrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood awed in silence; but Nestor the old<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bade bring the victims, and these on the wold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sight of Troy he slew, and so uplift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smoke of fire, and bloodsmoke, as a gift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acceptable to Him he hailed by name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kronion, sky-dweller, who giveth fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of the thunder; to Her&eacute; next, and Her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Maid of War and holy harbinger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Father Zeus, who bears the &AElig;gis dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shakes it when the storm peals overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightning splits the firmament with fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet forgat Poseidon, dark-haired sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the seas, and of great Ocean's flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girdler of the world. So back with slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pondered steps they all returned, and dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swallowed up Troy, and Horse, and them who stark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abode within it. And the great stars shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out over sea and land; and speaking none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nursing his arms, nursing within his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His enterprise, each hero sat at rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ignorant of the world of day and night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether he should live to see the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or see it but to perish in this cage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only Odysseus felt his heart engage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blithelier for the peril. He was stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thrives by daring, nor can dare enough.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Three days, three nights before the Skaian Gate<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sat they within their ambush, apt for fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days, three nights, the Trojans swarmed the walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towers or held high council in their halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What this portended, this o'erweening mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reared up so high no man stretching could pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand over the crupper, of such girth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of haunch, to span the pair no man on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could compass with both arms. But most their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were for the riders who in godlike guise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went naked into battle, as Gods use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untrammel'd by our shifts of shields and shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if we dread the earth whereof we are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sons of God, these: for bore not each a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ablaze upon his forelock? Lo, they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kastor and Polydeukes, who but they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come in to save their sister at the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And war for Troy, and root King Priam fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his demesne, him and his heirs for ever!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now call they soothsayers to make endeavour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With engines of their craft to read the thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But others urge them hale it to the King&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let him dispose," they say, "of it and us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And order as he will, from Pergamos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heave it o'er the sheer and bring to wreck;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>

<span class="i2">Herewith agreed the men of mysteries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raking the bloodsick earth to have the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And getting what they lookt for, as in sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man will do. So then they all fell to't<br /></span>

<h3>EIGHTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">High over Troy the windy citadel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pergamos, towereth, where is the cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And precinct of Athen&eacute;. There, till reived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They kept the Pallium, sacred and still grieved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all who held the city consecrate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Her, as first it was, till she learned hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what had once been lovely, and let in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden Aphrodit&eacute;, and sweet sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ensnare Prince Paris and send him awooing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A too-fair wife, to be his own undoing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy's and all the line's of Dardanos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That traced from Zeus to him, from him to Tros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tros to Ilos, to Laomedon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who begat Priam as his second son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But out of Troy Assarakos too came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whom came Kapys; and from him the fame<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of good Anchises, with whom Kypris lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In love and got Aineias. He, that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dreadful wrath, safe only out did come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And builded great Troy's line in greater Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now to the forecourt flock the Trojan folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the portent. Now they bring to yoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Priam's white horses, that the stricken king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself may see the wonder-working thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself invoke with his frail trembling voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good Twin Brethren for his aid and Troy's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So presently before it Priam stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father and King of Troy, with feeble hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mild pale eyes wherein Grief like a ghost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits; and about him all he has not lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his children gather, with grief-worn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Andromach&eacute; and her first, and last, born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy Astyanax. And there apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wise Aineias stands, of steadfast heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not acceptable&mdash;for some old grudge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inherited&mdash;Aineias, silent judge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of folly, as he had been since the sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Paris knelled the last days to begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he himself, that Paris, came not out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But kept his house in these his days of doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain of his footing, being of those<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="i0">On whom the faintest breath of censure blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chill as the wind that from the frozen North<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palsies the fount o' the blood. He dared not forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest men should see&mdash;and how not see? he thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Helen held him lightlier than she ought.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Helen came there, gentle as of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-held, sufficient to herself, not bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not modest nor immodest, taking none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For judge or jury of what she may have done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But doing all she was to do, sedate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent upon it and deliberate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she had been at first, so was she now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she had put behind her her old vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had no pride but thinking of her new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she was lovelier, of more burning hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her eyes there shone, for who could see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flickering light, half scare and half of glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made those iris'd orbs to wax and wane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the light of April days, when rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sun contend the sovereignty. She kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the King, and only closer crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let him feel her there when some harsh word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or look made her heart waver. Many she heard,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And much she saw, but knew the King her friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him only since great Hector met his end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while so pensive and demure she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one thin hand just peeping at her hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which close-folded her from head to knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart within her bosom hailed her&mdash;"Free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from thy thralldom, free to save, to give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To love, be loved again, and die to live!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So she&mdash;yet who had said, to see her there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet-faced woman, blue-eyed, still and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As windless dawn in some quiet mountain place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such a music let her passion race?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now hath the King his witless welcome paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now invoked the gods, and the cold shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once was Hector; now, being upheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By two his sons, with shaking hands of eld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knees of those two carved and gilded youths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He touches while he prays, and praying soothes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crying heart of Helen. But not so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kassandra views him pray, that well of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kassandra, she whom Loxias deceived<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With gift to see, and not to be believed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read within the heart of Time all truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see men blindly blunder, to have ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burn, to cry, "Out, haro!" and be a mock&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, and to know within this gross wood-block<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fate of all her kindred, and her own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unthinkable! Now with her terror blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her face, to blanch it like a sheet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now with bare frozen eyes which only greet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The viewless neighbours of our world she strips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veil and shrieketh Troy's apocalypse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Woe to thee, Ilios! The fire, the fire! And rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rain like to blood and tears to drown the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cover all the earth up in a shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One great death-clout for thee, Ilios the proud!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touch not, handle not&mdash;&mdash;" Outraged then she turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Helen&mdash;"O thou, for whom Troy shall be burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O ruinous face, O breasts made hard with gall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now are ye satisfied? Ye shall have all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bats shall make quick the night, and panting toads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make day a loathing to the light it brings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listen! Listen! they flock out; heed their wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods flee forth of this accurs&egrave;d haunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the memory of it an old chant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nursery song, an idle tale that's told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To children when your own sons are grown old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Argive bonds, and have no other joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than whispering to their offspring tales of Troy."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereat she laught&mdash;O bitter sound to hear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And struggled with herself, and grinned with fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And misery lest even now her fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should catch her and she be believed too late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is't possible, O Gods! Are ye so doomed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As not to know this Horse a mare, enwombed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men and swords? Know ye not there unseen<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By filching; forth Pyrrhos the braggart's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dared do violence to Hector dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But while he lived called Gods to serve his stead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth Aias like a beast, to mangle me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These things ye will not credit, but I see."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then once again, and last, she turned her switch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Helen, hissing, "Out upon thee, witch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth-handed traitress, speak thy secrets out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we may know thee, how thou goest about<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That which shall prove false paramour, false wife,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then, "O ruinous face, O ruinous face!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nothing more, for sudden all was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spent by her passion. Muttering, faint and wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the earth she sank, and to and fro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rocking, drew close her hood, and shrouded so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wild voice drowning, died in moans away.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But Helen stood bright-eyed as glancing day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near by the Horse, and with a straying hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did stroke it here and there, and listening stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaning her head towards its gilded flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strain to hear men's breath behind the plank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she had whispered if she dared some word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of promise; but afraid to be o'erheard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaned her head close and toucht it with her cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then drew again to Priam, schooled and meek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Menelaus felt her touch, and mum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat on, nursing his mighty throw to come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Aias started, with some cry uncouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vile, but fast Odysseus o'er his mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapt hand, and checkt his foul perseverance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek in every deed his own essence.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now when the ways were darkened, and the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank red to sea, and homeward all had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that distraught Kassandra, who still served<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple whence the Goddess long had swerved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Athen&eacute;, hating Troy and loving them<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who craved to snatch and make a diadem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Priam's regal crown for other brows&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, though foredoomed she knew, held to her vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And duly paid the thankless evening rite&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came to Paris' house late in the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De&iuml;phobus his brother, young and trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For speech with fair-tressed Helen, for whose slim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And budded grace long had he sighed in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found her in full hall, and showed his pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And need of her. To whom when she draws close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hot and urgent crying words he shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His case, hers now, that here she tarry not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest evil hap more dread than she can wot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For this," he says, "is Troy's extremest hour."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when to that she bowed her head, the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his high vision made him vehement:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dark sets the sun," he cried, "and day is spent";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she said, "Nay, the sun will rise with day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall bathe in light, lift hands and pray."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Thou lift up hands, bound down to a new lord!"<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He mocked; then whispered, "Lady, with a sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cut thy bonds if so thou wilt."<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She moved: "No sword, but a cry of the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall loose me."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then he said, "Hear what I cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my heart unto thine: fly, Helen, fly!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat she shook her head and sighed, "Even so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother, I fly where thou canst never go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far go I, out of ken of thee and thy peers."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He knew not what she would, but said, "Thy fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are of the Gods and holy dooms and Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mine the present menace in the gate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I would save thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">"I fear it not," said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But wait it here."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">He cried, "Here shalt thou see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Spartan, and his bitter sword-point feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against thy bosom."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"I bare it to the steel,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saith she. He then, "If ever man deserved thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By service, I am he, who'd die to serve thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glowing she heard him, being quickly moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By kindness, loving ever where she was loved.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But now her heart was fain for rest; the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called her to sleep and dreams. So with a light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gentle hand upon him, "Brother, farewell,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, "I stay the issue, and foretell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour therein at least."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Then at the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kissed him. And she saw his face no more.<br /></span>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now Dawn came weeping forth, and on the crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida faced a chill wind from the West.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the gray sea wrack-laden it blew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And howled among the towers, and stronger grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As crept unseen the sun his path of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she who in the temple all that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kept her rueful watch, the prophetess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kassandra, peering sharply, heard the press<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush of flight above her, and with sick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreboding waited; and the air grew thick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flying shapes immortal overhead.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As in late Autumn, when the leaves are shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dismal flit about the empty ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And country folk provide against dark days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heap the woodstack, and their stores repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attent you know the quickening of the air,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And closer yet the swish and sweep and swing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wings innumerable, emulous to bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds to broader skies and kindlier sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know indeed that winter is begun&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So seeing first, then hearing, she knew the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was come when Troy must fall, and not a tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be left to front the morrow. And she covered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head and mourned, while one by one they hovered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above their shrines, then flockt and faced the dawn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">First, in her car of shell and amber, drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By clustering doves with burnisht wings, a-throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passes Queen Aphrodit&eacute;, and her song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sweet and sharp: "I gave my sacred zone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To warm thy bosom, Helen which by none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That live by labour and in tears are born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighing go their ways, has e'er been worn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It kindled in thine eyes the lovelight, showed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy cooing in the night, thy deep sleep after,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy rapture of the morning, love renewed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the shadowed day to sit and brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On what has been and what should be again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt not? Nay, I proffer not in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My gifts, for I am all or will be nought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, where I am can be no other thought."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus to the wooded heights of Ida she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was drawn, hid in that pearly galaxy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of snow-white pigeons.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Next upon the height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pergamos uplift a beam of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for its core enshrined a naked youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden and fierce. She knew the God sans ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him who had given woeful prescience to her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apollo, once her lover and her wooer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood as one stands glorying in his grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strength, full in the sun, though on her place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the temple court no sun at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone, nor as yet upon the topmost wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was any tinge of him, but all showed gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sodden in the wind and blown sea-spray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to him dared she lift her voice in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor scarce her eyes to see him.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<span class="i14">To him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came swift a spirit in shape of virgin slim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With snooded hair and kirtle belted trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short to the knee; and in her face the gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had blown bright sanguine colour. Free and hale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was; and in her hand she held a bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unstrung, and o'er her shoulders there did go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A baldrick that made sharp the cleft betwixt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sudden breasts&mdash;to that a quiver fixt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing gold arrow-points. No God there is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Heaven more swift than Delian Artemis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young, the pure health-giver of the Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who loveth all things born, and brings to birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after slays with merciful sudden death&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And to whom all the praise of him who writes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These two she saw like meteorites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flare down the wind and burn afar, then fade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Leto next, a mother grave and staid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drave out her chariot, which two winged stags drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift following, robed in gown of inky blue,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And hooded; and her hand which held the hood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed like a patch of snow left in a wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hyacinths bring down to earth the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in her wake a winging company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dense as the cloud of gulls which from a rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sea lifts up in myriads, if the knock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of oars assail their peace, she saw, and mourned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The household gods. For outward they too turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirits of the streams and water-brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nymphs who haunt the pastures, or in nooks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woodlands dwell. There like a lag of geese<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew in long straying lines the Oreades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in wild dunes and commons have their haunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sped the Hamadryads; there aslant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from the sea, but wheeling ere they crost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sisters, thronged the river-nymphs, a host;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the Gods of homestead and the hearth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As voiceless and as lustreless, astare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For imminent Death, Kassandra croucht beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her very doom, herself the bride of Death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the temple's forecourt reared the mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that which was to bring the woe to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hidden in him both her murderers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrung at their nails.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And slow the long day wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all the city broods. The chiefs keep house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gather on the wall, or make carouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To simulate a freedom they feel not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at street corners men in shift or plot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whisper together, or in the market-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gather, and peer each other in the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furtively, seeking comfort against care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose eyes, meeting by chance, shift otherwhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In haste. But in the houses, behind doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuttered and barred, the women scrub their floors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ply their looms as busily: for they<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ever cure care with care, and if a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be heavy lighten it with heavier task;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for their griefs wear beauty like a mask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answer heart's presaging with a song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their brave lips, and render right for wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little, by outward seeming, do they know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of doom at hand, of fate or blood or woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor how their children, playing by their knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must end this day of busyness-at-ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shrieking night, with clamour for their bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a red bath, and a cold stone for a bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the staring moon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Now sinks the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood-red into the heavy sea and dun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from him, as he were stuck with swords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great streams of light go upward. Then the lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of havoc and unrest prepare their storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the silent city, vulture forms&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eris and Enyo, Alk&eacute;, Iok&eacute;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The biter, the sharp-bitten, the mad, the fey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hover and light on pinnacle and tower:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray Erinnyes, watchful for the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Haro be the wail. And down the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a white squall flung At&eacute; with a cry<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That sounded like the wind in a ship's shrouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shrill and wild at once. The driving clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surging together, blotted out the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beach&eacute;d ships, the plain with mound and tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slantwise came the sheeted rain, and fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darkness settled in. Kassandra cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mantle o'er her head, and with slow feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entered her shrine deserted, there to greet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fate when it should come; and merciful Sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befriended her.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Now from his lair did creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Odysseus forth unarmed, his sword and spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the Horse, and warily to peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spy his whereabouts the Ithacan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went doubtful. Then his dreadful work began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down the bare way of steep Pergamos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the dark he sought for Paris' house.<br /></span>

<h3>TENTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE</h4>

<div class="cpoem22"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There in her cage roamed Helen light and fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unresting, with bright eyes and straining ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever stayed her steps; but first the hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ranged, touching the pillars; next to the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went out and shot her gaze into the murk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereas the ships should lie; then to her work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the great loom turned and wove a shift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But idly, waiting always for some lift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the close-wrapping fog that might discover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moving hosts, the spearmen of her lover&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lover and husband, master and lord of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coming at last to take a slave to wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as wide-eyed she stared to feel her heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap to her side, she felt the warm tears start,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thankt the Goddess for the balm they brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to her women, withal so highly wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hope and care and waiting, she was mild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gentle-voiced, and playful as a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sups the moment's joy, and nothing heeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time past or time to come, but fills all needs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With present kindness. She would laugh and talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take arms, suffer embraces, even walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The terrace 'neath the eyes of all her fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seem to heed what they might show or prate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if her whole heart's heart were in this house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not at fearful odds and perilous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should one speak of Paris, as to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Would that our lord might see thee go so gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his house!" Gently she'd bend her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to her breast and pluck a vagrant thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from her tunic's hem, and looking wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze at her hand which on her bosom's rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit like a butterfly and quivered there.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now in the dusk, with Paris otherwhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At council with the chieftains, into the hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Helen there, was come, adventuring all,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Odysseus in the garb of countryman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A herdsman from the hills, with stain of tan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his neck and arms, with staff and scrip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round each leg bound crosswise went a strip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of good oxhide. Within the porch he came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And louted low, and hailed her by her name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among her maidens easy to be known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though not so tall as most, and not full blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shape and flush like a full-hearted rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a summer wave her bosom flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lax and most gentle, and her tired sweet face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems pious as the moon in a blue space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of starless heaven, and in her eyes the hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of early morning, gray through mist of blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not by a flaunted beauty is she guessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen of them all, but by the right expressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her calm gaze and fearless, and that hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her lips which Gods have. Nay, not cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou holy one, not cold thy lips, which say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in a sigh, and with one word betray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passion of thy heart! But who can wis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fainting piercing message of thy kiss?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O blest initiate&mdash;let him live to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy godhead, show himself thy miracle!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when she saw him there with his head bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humble hands, deeply her fair face glowed,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And broad across the iris swam the black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until her eyes showed darkling. "Friend, your lack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me," she said, "and what is mine to give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is yours; but little my prerogative<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in this house, where I am not the queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You call me, but another name, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serves me about the country you are of,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Ilios gives me too, but not in love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet are we all alike in evil plight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should be tender of each other's right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of each other's wrongdoing, and wrongs done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon us. Have you wife and little one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hungry at home? Have you a son afield?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or do you mourn? Alas, I cannot wield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword you lack, nor bow nor spear afford<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve...."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said, "Nay, you can sheathe the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slack bowstring, and make spear a hunter's toy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, I come to end this war of Troy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your good pleasure."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">With her steady eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwinking fixt, "Let you and me devise,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said she, "this happy end of bow and spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall we serve the land. You have my ear;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Speak then."<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"But so," he said, "these maidens have it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we save Troy alone, or never save it."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turning she bid them leave her with a nod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they obeyed. Swift then and like a God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seemed, with bright all-knowing eyes and calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gesture of high-held head, and open palm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet. "Laertes' son, what news bringst thou?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Lady," he said, "the best. The hour is now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stand within the heaven-establisht walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We gird the seat. Within an hour it falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seat divine of Dardanos and Tros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After our ten years' travail and great loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heroes not yet rested, but to rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then she laid her hand upon her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay it. "Who are ye that stand here-by?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Desperate men," he said, "prepared to die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wilt have it so. Chief is there none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the ships but Nestor. All are gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth in the Horse. Under thy covering hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou holdest all Achaia. Here we stand,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Epeios, Pyrrhos, Antiklos, with these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cretan Idomeneus, Meriones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aias the Lokrian, Teukros, Diomede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the loud war-cry, next thy man indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden-haired Menelaus the robbed King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Agamemnon by him, and I who bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This news and must return to take what lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou choosest us; for all is thine, God wot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To end or mend, to make or mar at will."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A weighty utterance, but she heard the thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her heart, and listened only that&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know her love so near. So near he sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden when she that toucht the Horse's flank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could have toucht him! "Odysseus!" her voice sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the low tone of the soft murmuring dove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nests and broods, "Odysseus, heard my love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My whisper of his name when close I stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stroked the Horse?"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">"I heard and understood,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "and Lokrian Aias would have spoken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I not clapt a hand to his mouth&mdash;else broken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By garish day had been our house of dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our necks too. I heard a woman scream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near by and cry upon the Ruinous Face,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But none made answer to her."<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Nought she says<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that but "I am ready; let my lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come when he will. Humbly I wait his word."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"That word I bring," Odysseus said, "he comes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Await him here."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Her wide eyes were the homes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of long desire. "Ah, let me go with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as I am; from this dark house take me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Paris is abroad!"<br /></span>
<span class="i10">He shook his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not so, but he must find thee here abed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Paris here."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The light died out; a mask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of panic was her face, what time her task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stared on a field of white horror like blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here! But there must be strife then!"<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Well and good,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said he.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then she, shivering and looking small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And one must fall?" she said; he, "One must fall."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Reeling she turned her pincht face other way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And muttered with her lips, grown cold and gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fawning came at him, and with her hands<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Besought him, but her voice made no demands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only her haunted eyes were quick, and prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, not to fall through me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">"By thee," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The deed is to be done."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">She droopt adown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lovely head; he heard her broken moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Have I not caused enough of blood-shedding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And enough women's tears? Is not the sting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp enough of the knife within my side?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more she could.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then he, "Think not to avoid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lot of man, who payeth the full price<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each deed done, and riddeth vice by vice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the curse upon him. The doom is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By God decreed, that for thy forfeit bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Sparta thou shalt pay the price in Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonour for lost honour, pain for joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what hot thought impelled, by that alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Win back; by violence violence atone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If by chicane thou fleddest, by chicane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Win back thy blotted footprints. Out again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all thine arts of kisses slow and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of smiles and stroking hands, and crooning song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whenas full-fed with love thou lulledst asleep;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Renew thine eyebright glances, whisper and creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twine about his neck thy wreathing arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we with spears so do thou with thy charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm thee and wait the hour of fire and smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purge this robbery. Paris by the stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him he robbed shall wash out his old cheat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blood, and thou, woman, by new deceit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him redeem thy first. For thus God saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traitress, thou shalt betray thy thief to death."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He ceased, and she by misery made wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And witless, shook, and like a little child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed piteous, and asked, "What must I do?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He answered, "Hold him by thee, falsely true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the King stand armed within the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to take his blood-price. Even thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By shame alone shalt thou redeem thy shame."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now she claspt his knee and cried his name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mercy! I cannot do it. Let me die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sooner than go to him so. What, must I lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one and other, make myself a whore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so go back to Sparta, nevermore<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To hold my head up level with my slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dare to touch my child?"<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Said he, "Let knaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deal knavishly till freedom they can win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so let sinners purge themselves of sin."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fiercely looking on her where she croucht<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by his knees, his whole mind he avoucht:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How many hast thou sent the way of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thy hot fault? What ghosts like wandering breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shudder and wail unhouseled on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shreds of Achaian honour? What hearts in pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry the night through? What souls this very night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fare forth? Art thou alone to sup delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone to lap in pleasantness, who first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only, with thy lecher and his thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought all the harm? Only for thy smooth sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Paris reive, and Menelaus ache,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hector die ashamed, and Peleus' son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand to the arrow, and Aias Telamon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find madness and self-murder for the crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his travail?" He eyed her up and down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sternly, as measuring her worth in scorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not thus may traffic any woman born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While men endure cold nights and burning days,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Hunger and wretchedness."<br /></span>
<span class="i12">She stands, she says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Enough&mdash;I cannot answer. Tell me plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I must do."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"At dark," he said, "we gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gates and open them. A trumpet's blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will sound the entry of the host. Hold fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Paris then. We storm the citadel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Pergamos; that won, the horn will tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sack begun. But hold thou Paris bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast in thine arms. Once more the horn shall sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That third is doom for him. Release him then."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All blank she gazed. "Unarmed to face armed men?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Unarmed," he said, "to meet his judgment day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now was thick silence broken; now no way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her to shift her task nor he his fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keenly she heeds. "'Tis Paris at the gate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What now? Whither away? Where wilt thou hide?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He lookt her in the face. "Here I abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he may do. Was it not truth I spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all Hellas lay in thy hand? Now take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What counsel or what comfort may avail."<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Paris stood in the door and cried her Hail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hail to thee, Rose of the World!" then saw the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knit his brows upon him, close to scan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His features; but Odysseus had his hood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadowing his face. Some time the Trojan stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judging, then said, "Thou seek'st? What seekest thou?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"A debt is owed me. I seek payment now."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he was told; but he drew nearer yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I would know more of thee and of thy debt,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And then Odysseus, "This thy strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath ruined all my fields which are my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought murrain on my beasts, cold ash to my hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emptiness to my croft. Hunger and dearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these enough? Who pays me?"<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Then Paris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I pay, but first will know what man it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am to pay, and in what kind." So said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snatching the hood, he whipt it from his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lookt and knew the Ithacan. "Now by Zeus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treachery here!" He swung his sword-arm loose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth of his cloak and set hand to his sword;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But Helen softly called him: "Hath my lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No word of greeting for his bondwoman?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway he went to her, and left the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took her in his arms, and held her close.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light of foot, Odysseus quit the house.<br /></span>

<h3>ELEVENTH STAVE</h3>

<h4>THE BEGUILING OF PARIS</h4>

<div class="cpoem25"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now Paris tipt her chin and turned her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upwards to his that fondly he might trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of her budded lips, and stoop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss them softly; and fingered in the loop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That held her girdle, and closer pressed, on fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards her; for her words had stung desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anew; and wooing in his fond boy's way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispered and lookt his passion; then to pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began: "Ah, love, long strange to me, behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy winter past, and come the days of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasance of the spring! For in thine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see his light and hail him as he flies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, cloud him not, nor veil him"&mdash;for she made<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To turn her face, saying, "Ah, let them fade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul thou prisonest here is grayer far."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he would give no quarter now. "O star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O beacon-star, shine on me in the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may wash me in thy bath of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking my fill of thee; so cleans&eacute;d all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And healed, I rise renewed to front what call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be!" which said, with conquest in his bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his eyes assurance, in high tones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called her maids, bade take her and prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The couch, and her to be new-wedded there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For long had they been strangers to their bliss.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So by the altar standeth she submiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watchful, praying silent and intense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a strange-figured Goddess, to his sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew but Aphrodit&eacute;. "Love, what now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is thy God? What secret rite hast thou?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For grave and stern above that altar stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her&eacute; the Queen of Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">In dry mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered him, "Chaste wives to her do pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they couch, Blest be the strife! You say<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We are to be new-wedded. Pour with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libation that we love not fruitlessly."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So said, she took the well-filled cup and poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed, saying, "O Mother, not abhorred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be this my service of thee. Count it not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offence, nor let my prayers be forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When reckoning comes of things done and not done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By me thy child, or to me, hapless one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unloving paramour and unloved wife!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Her&eacute;, to thee for issue of the strife!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried Paris then, and poured. So Helen went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let her maids adorn her to his bent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then took he joy of her, and little guessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cared what she might give or get. Possest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her body by his body, but her mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Searcht terribly the issue. As one blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Explores the dark about him in broad day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fingers in the air, so as she lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lax in his arms, her fainting eyes, aglaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For terror coming, sought escape all ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas for her! What way for woman fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose joy no fairer makes her than despair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her burning lips that kisses could not cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her beating heart that not love made so full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surging of her breast, her clinging hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here are such signs as lover understands,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But fated Paris nowise. Her soul, distraught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save him, proved the net where he was caught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For more she anguisht lest love be his bane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiercelier spurred she him, to make him fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that which had been ruinous to all.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But all the household gathered on the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While these two in discordant bed were plight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watcht the Achaian fires. No beacon-light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed by the shore, but countless, flickering, streamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innumerable lights, wove, dipt and gleamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like fireflies on a night of summer heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withal one way they moved, though many beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across and back, and mingled with the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon a great glare kindled from the crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida, and was answered by a blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the ships, which threw up in red haze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge forms of prow and beak. Then from the Mound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ilos fire shot up, from sacred ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out the mazy glory of moving lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sped and flared, as of the meteorites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In autumn some fly further, brighter courses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A chariot! They heard the thunder of the horses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they flew the torch left a bright wake.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thus to one another woman spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo, more lights race! They follow him, they near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch and draw level. Hark! Now you can hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tramp of men!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Says one, "That baleful sheen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is light upon their spears. The Greeks, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are coming up to rescue or requite."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But then her mate: "They mass, they fill the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With panic terror."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">True, that all night things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled as they came. They heard the flickering wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of countless birds in haste, and as they flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fled the dark away. Light waxed and grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the dead of night was vivified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And radiant opened out the countryside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pulsing flames of fire, which gleamed and glanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flickered, wavered, yet never stayed advance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sun rising high o'er Ida cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beats a sea-path in flakes of molten gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stretcht from shore to Troy that litten stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moved and shuddered, restless as a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever nearing, till on spear and shield<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They saw light like the moon on a drowned field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the glare of torches saw and read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray faces, like the legions of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent about the walls, and waiting there.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But in the fragrant chamber Helen the fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay close in arms, and Paris slept, his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her bosom, deep as any dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sudden there smote the blast of a great horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Single, long-held and shuddering, and far-borne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a deathless silence. Paris stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that soft pillow, and listened while they heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many men running frantically, with feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slapt the stones, and voices in the street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of question and call&mdash;"Oh, who are ye that run?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What of the night?" "O peace!" And some lost one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailed like a woman, and her a man did curse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there were scuffling, prayers, and then worse&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silence. But the running ended not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Paris lay alistening with a knot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Helen's loose hair twisting round his finger.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"O love," he murmured low, "I may not linger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The street's awake. Alas, thou art too kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a warrior's bride." Sighing, she twined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her arm about his neck and toucht his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pressed it gently back to its warm place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pillowing. And Paris kissed her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slept; but her heart's riot gave no rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As quaking there she lay, awaiting doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then afar off rose clamour, and the room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was fanned with sudden light and sudden dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on a summer night in a great park<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed forth you see each tuft of grass or mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon the drowning blackness, while the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Zeus's thunder hardens every close:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So here the chamber glared, then dipt, and rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That far confus&eacute;d tumult, and now and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scurrying feet of passion-driven men.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thrilling she waited with sick certainty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of doom inexorable, while the struck city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fought its death-grapple, and the windy height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pergamos became a shambles. White<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy shrines stared on a field of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with blank eyes the emptied temples stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While murder raved before them, and below<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all about the city ran the woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of women for their children. Then the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst in the citadel, and overcame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darkness, and the time seemed of broad day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Helen stared unwinking where she lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillowing Paris.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Now glad and long and shrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second trumpet sounds. They have the hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Troy is down, is down! Starting, he wakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turns him in her arms. His face she takes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her two hands and turns it up to hers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing she says, nothing she does, nor stirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her still scrutiny, nor so much as blinks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes, deep-searching, of whose blue he drinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fond believes her all his own, while she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marvels that aught of his she e'er could be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In times bygone. But now he is on fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again, and urges on her his desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loses all the sense of present needs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him in burning Troy, where Priam bleeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Head-smitten, trodden on his palace-floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white Kassandra yieldeth up her flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Aias' lust, and of the Dardan race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Survive he only, renegade disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He only and Aineias the wise prince.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But now is crying fear abroad and wins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very household of the shameful lover;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now are the streets alive, for worse in cover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a trapt rat to die than fight the odds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the sky. Now women shriek to the Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men run witlessly, and in and out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Greeks press, burning, slaying, and the rout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Screameth to Heaven. As at sea the mews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pack, their wings battling, when some fresh wrack strews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tideway, and in greater haste to stop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others from prey, will let their morsel drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the while make harsh lament&mdash;so here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The avid spoilers bickered in their fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be man&#339;uvred out of robbery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tore the spoil, and mangled shamefully<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bodies of men to strip them, and in haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To forestall ravishers left the victims chaste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ares, the yelling God, and At&eacute; white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept like a snow-storm over Troy that night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towers rockt, and in the naked glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fire the smoke climbed to the upper air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clamour was as of the dead broke loose.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Menelaus his stern way pursues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the wicked house with chosen band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cometh, his good sword naked in his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, while Paris loves and holds her fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arms, the third horn sounds a shattering blast,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Long-held, triumphant; and about the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathers the household, to cry, to pray, to implore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the last break in and scream the truth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Greeks! The Greeks! Save yourselves!"<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Then in sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starts Paris out of bed, and as he goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees in the eyes of Helen all she knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all believes; and with his utter loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her rises the man in him that was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere luxury had entered blood and bone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him. No word he said, but let one groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned his dying eyes to hers, and read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein his fate, that to her he was dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long dead and cold in grave. Whereat he past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the door, and met his end at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As man, not minion.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">But the woman fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on her face, half buried in her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked and prone beneath her saving sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet enheartened new life to begin.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of speech, nor impotent of passion&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The which his tones gave earnest of<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who, drawing nearer, came to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So close beside her that one hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lit on her shoulder&mdash;yet no touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felt: "O maiden overmuch,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grieved, "O body far too sweet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of bed and board and ingle-nook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With earth-bound woman, earth-born child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but high love is free and wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And centreth not in mortal things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the soul giveth he wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the soul strikes partnership,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may two let corruption slip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breasting level, with far eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted, seek haven in the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untrammel'd by the earthly mesh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou," said he, "of fairy flesh,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Trotting home like a tired dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mountain slopes 'twixt the junipers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flamed oleanders near the sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus on the mountains chose the bears,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Anguishing in their loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' the dense nights, far in the forest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so collected went she, and sure<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For untold trespass, to seek the sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He'd stretch his arms, broken with strife<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her sweet familiarities, blind<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus his black ferment boil'd. O' nights<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In a chill sweat, he'd tear at himself,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In June I brought her roses, and she cupt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One slim bud in her hand and cherisht it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each other's sweetness; but the flower was lit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She laid it blushing, warm and doubly blest.<br /></span>

<div class="block1"><p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"The three plays have throughout a high level of
dramatic interest, and they have moments of great tragic beauty.... It
is not a book of sporadic beauties, for its most remarkable quality is its
unity of interest and effect. The chorus has many passages of lyrical
charm ... but it is the great story which moves us most deeply, the
stress of dramatic and logical sequence, so that we have no time to notice
the art of it all. This is a high tribute to Mr. Hewlett's technical skill.
At its best the irregular verse has a sharp freshness which the more
orthodox metres could scarcely give."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"The poetry is full of music, yet refreshingly
free from monotony, and in passages when swift broken phrases are
of the essence of the atmosphere the effect is splendidly dramatic and
austere. Mr. Hewlett is to be congratulated upon a high success in a
field of the worthiest enterprise."</p>

<p><i>OBSERVER.</i>&mdash;"There is no single passage that can fail to charm
when read aloud, woven with magic of rhythm, and music of phrase. It
is a great heroic subject, nobly conceived, and finely and thoughtfully
executed."</p>

<p><i>BLACK AND WHITE.</i>&mdash;"<i>The Agonists</i> is more than fine verse;
it is literature impregnated with the purest fragrance of the classic spirit."</p>

<p><i>DAILY EXPRESS.</i>&mdash;"There is real drama in <i>The Agonists</i>, and there
is much splendid beauty."</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"Of the beauty of a great deal of the
poetry it is difficult to speak too highly."</p>

<p><i>STANDARD.</i>&mdash;"The imaginative grasp of these dramas, as well as
their lyric charm, is unquestionable, and so also is the rare skill with
which the strife of elemental passions is described and the action of the
relentless laws which made men of old regard life as the sport of the gods."</p>

<p class="head3"><b>THE FOREST LOVERS:</b> <span class="smcap">A Romance</span>.</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"<i>The Forest Lovers</i> is no mere literary <i>tour de force</i>, but an
uncommonly attractive romance, the charm of which is greatly enhanced by the
author's excellent style."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Maurice Hewlett's <i>The Forest Lovers</i> stands
out with conspicuous success.... There are few books of this season which achieve
their aim so simply and whole-heartedly as Mr. Hewlett's ingenious and enthralling
romance."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>THE SONG OF RENNY.</b></p>

<p><i>EVENING STANDARD.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Hewlett has produced a remarkable series of
historical novels, and <i>The Song of Renny</i> is one of the best of them.... An admirable
romance, full of 'go' and colour and good temper."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Hewlett is mounted upon his Pegasus again,
riding full tilt against a rushing wind, with the moonlight of imagination playing
glorious tricks upon all the marvellous sights around him."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>THE QUEEN'S QUAIR:</b> <span class="smcap">or, The Six Years' Tragedy</span>.</p>

<p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM.</i>&mdash;"A fine book, fine not only for its extraordinary wealth of
incidental beauties, but also for the consistency of conception and the tolerant
humanity with which its main theme is put before you."</p>

<p><i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"That Mr. Maurice Hewlett would give us a
flaming, wonderful picture of Queen Mary was a foregone conclusion."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>RICHARD YEA-AND-NAY.</b></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederic Harrison</span> in <i>THE FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW</i>.&mdash;"Such
historic imagination, such glowing colour, such crashing speed, set forth in such
pregnant form, carry me away spell-bound."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"The story carries us along as though throughout
we were galloping on strong horses. There is a rush and fervour about it all which
sweeps us off our feet till the end is reached, and the tale is done. It is very clever,
very spirited."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>LITTLE NOVELS OF ITALY.</b></p>

<p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"And even such as fail to understand, will very
certainly enjoy&mdash;enjoy the sometimes gay and sometimes biting humour, the deft
delineation, the fine quality of colour, the delicately-flavoured phrasing."</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"The most finished studies which have appeared
since some of the essays of Walter Pater."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>OPEN COUNTRY:</b> <span class="smcap">A Comedy With a Sting</span>.</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"<i>Open Country</i> is a beautiful bit of work, a work
that is inspired through and through with a genuine love for what is pure and
beautiful. Mr. Hewlett's main figures have not only a wonderful charm in themselves,
but they are noble, simple, and true-hearted creatures. Sanchia, the
heroine, is a divine creation."</p>

<p><i>EVENING STANDARD.</i>&mdash;"<i>Open Country</i> is an important book and a fine
novel."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>REST HARROW:</b> <span class="smcap">A Comedy of Resolution</span>.</p>

<p><i>DAILY NEWS.</i>&mdash;"<i>Rest Harrow</i> has not only the effect of providing an
&aelig;sthetically logical conclusion to the motives of <i>Open Country</i>, but it throws
back a radiant retrospective influence, enhancing the value of what has preceded
it.... In many ways the best piece of work Mr. Hewlett has done."</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"The present book certainly sustains the charm
of <i>Open Country</i> without any faltering of dramatic movement."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>THE STOOPING LADY.</b></p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"A wondrously beautiful piece of fiction, gallant and
romantic, a high treat for lovers of good reading."</p>

<p><i>WORLD.</i>&mdash;"A rarely picturesque and beautiful production."</p>

<p><i>EVENING STANDARD.</i>&mdash;"A story which fascinates him who reads."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>MRS. LANCELOT:</b> <span class="smcap">A Comedy of Assumptions</span>.</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;"The story, as a whole, sustains a lofty level of
creative vigour, and is dignified, moreover, with something of the epic flavour, as
the old order is seen breaking up under the advance of new ideas and revolutionary
enthusiasms.... Among the best books that the present age is likely to produce."</p>

<p><i>DAILY GRAPHIC.</i>&mdash;"The best work of its kind since Meredith."</p>


<p class="head3"><b>FOND ADVENTURES:</b> <span class="smcap">Tales of the Youth of the World</span>.</p>

<p><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"The materials for romance provided by this period (the
Renaissance) are inexhaustibly rich, and Mr. Maurice Hewlett is admirably
equipped for the task of reconstituting many of its phases."</p>

<p><i>EVENING STANDARD.</i>&mdash;"The present volume is a rich mine of beauty.
It contains four fine romantic tales."</p>
